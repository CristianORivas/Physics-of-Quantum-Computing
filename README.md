Physics of Quantum Computing
ABSTRACT
Quantum computers are at the forefront of technology development right now. The race to understand the differences between simulating quantum mechanics on classical computers vs quantum computers is currently being quantified. The uses for quantum computers are still being laid out although there are a few algorithms that work for them, such as Shor’s algorithm. The application of these algorithms helps distinguish how and why simulating quantum mechanics on a quantum computer is more beneficial than simulating it on a classical computer. Using qubits we are able to hold multiple states of information in a single process until a highly probabilistic answer is achieved to move on. Using fundamental laws of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement we are able to give qubits a purpose in quantum computers to hold multiple states of information rather than a simple binary state of 0 or 1. An understanding of how quantum mechanics works in these systems using nonrelativistic many-body systems (the Schrödinger equation), relativistic many-fermion systems (the many-body Dirac equation), and Gauge field theories is discussed. Additionally, the exponential return rate of a quantum computer’s solution and why its processes are able to handle more complex interactions and calculations than the classical alternative is explored.
